# cross-stitch-code

Currently: 
- Data structure that holds sequence of colors, converts to cross stitch pattern, organizes/prints to console.
- Allows user to change colors individually.



Next Steps:

- Fix "change all of one color" method.
- Add in enum data & calculate thread length needed per color.
- Connect DMCthreads database to Color class.
- Print colors to graph/visual representation.



Goal:

- Accept user photo input and convert to pattern.
